# CLAUDE.md

Context and working notes for LLM agents (and humans) working on **Juras**, an
Android app for controlling JURA coffee machines over WiFi.

---

## 1. What this project is

Juras is a native Android app that talks to a **JURA coffee machine** fitted with
a **WiFi Smart Connect v2** module, over the machine's local TCP protocol (port
51515). The goal is a clean, modern alternative to JURA's own *J.O.E.* app:
brew products, read maintenance status, and read product counters directly from
the machine on the local network.

This is being built **step by step**. See [Roadmap](#7-roadmap--status) for the
current state — do not assume features exist; check the code.

---

## 2. Tech stack

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Language | **Kotlin** |
| UI | **Jetpack Compose** + Material 3 |
| Build | **Gradle (Kotlin DSL)** with a version catalog (`gradle/libs.versions.toml`) |
| AGP | 8.10.1 |
| Kotlin | 2.1.0 (Compose compiler via `org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose`) |
| Gradle wrapper | 8.13 |
| compileSdk / targetSdk | 36 |
| minSdk | 26 |
| JVM bytecode target | 11 |
| Package / applicationId | `automatl.juras` |

Versions are centralized in [`gradle/libs.versions.toml`](gradle/libs.versions.toml).
Prefer adding dependencies there (the catalog) rather than inline in
`app/build.gradle.kts`.

## 3. Build & run

### Local dev environment (developer's machine)

These paths are specific to the current developer's Windows machine — adjust if
yours differs:

- Android SDK: `E:\Bg\android-sdk` (also recorded in `local.properties`, which is
  git-ignored)
- Android Studio: `D:\Home\Kykc\Apps\Jetbrains\Android Studio`
- JDK 21: `D:\Home\Kykc\Apps\scoop\apps\temurin21-jdk\current`
- System images available: `android-33`, `android-34-ext9`, `android-36`

### From Android Studio

Open the `juras/` folder as a project, let Gradle sync, pick an emulator (any
API ≥ 26; `android-36` matches target best), and Run.

### From the command line

The Gradle **wrapper** is committed, so no system Gradle is needed — but
`JAVA_HOME` must point at a JDK 21 (the bundled wrapper uses it). On PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME = "D:\Home\Kykc\Apps\scoop\apps\temurin21-jdk\current"
cd juras
.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug      # build debug APK
.\gradlew.bat :app:installDebug       # install on a running emulator/device
```

Debug APK output: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

> Note: a system Gradle (e.g. 9.x via scoop) exists on the dev machine but is
> **only** used to (re)generate the wrapper. Day-to-day builds go through
> `./gradlew`, pinned to 8.13, which is compatible with AGP 8.10.1.

```

When the networking/protocol layer is added, keep it separate from UI — e.g. a
`automatl.juras.jura` package for transport/cipher/commands, with Compose UI
consuming it via a ViewModel.

## 5. JURA WiFi protocol — essentials

This is a condensed reference so an agent can work without the external docs.
The **full** protocol reference and a **known-working Python client** live in the
parent workspace (outside this git repo):

- `../JURA_WIFI_PROTOCOL.md` — full protocol spec (reverse-engineered from J.O.E.)
- `../jura.py` — working CLI client (cipher, auth, brew, stats, maintenance, shell)
- `../jura_creds.txt` — example credentials line (PIN, hex device name, auth token)

Reference target machine: **JURA E6 (EF1030M)**, Smart Connect module TT237W.

### Transport
- TCP, port **51515**, **one** session at a time (machine refuses/drops a 2nd).
- Machine is found via UDP broadcast beacon (article number at beacon bytes 68–69),
  or just use a known IP / mDNS.

### Wire framing
Every message (both directions) is framed:
```
0x2A | <key byte> | <encrypted payload> | 0x0D 0x0A
```
- `0x2A` (`*`) start sentinel; `0x0D 0x0A` (`\r\n`) end sentinel.
- A random **key byte** per message; pick `key` where `(key & 0x0F)` ∉ {14,15}.
- Payload is the ASCII command text (including trailing `\r\n`), encrypted.
- **SPECIAL bytes** `{0x00,0x0A,0x0D,0x26,0x1B}` are escaped anywhere they appear
  (key byte or ciphertext) as `0x1B, (B XOR 0x80)`.

### Cipher (symmetric nibble cipher — same function encrypts & decrypts)
```python
LUT_A = [1,0,3,2,15,14,8,10,6,13,7,12,11,9,5,4]
LUT_B = [9,12,6,11,10,15,2,14,13,0,4,3,1,8,7,5]
def cipher_nibble(nibble, counter, kH, kL):
    iB   = (nibble + counter + kH) % 256 % 16
    i11  = counter >> 4
    idx1 = (i11 + LUT_A[iB] + kL - counter - kH) % 256 % 16
    idx2 = (LUT_B[idx1] + kH + counter - kL - i11) % 256 % 16
    return (LUT_A[idx2] - counter - kH) % 256 % 16
```
Each byte = two nibbles; `counter` starts at 0, +2 per byte;
`kH=(key>>4)&0xF`, `kL=key&0xF`.

### Authentication (first exchange after connect)
Send `@HP:<b_val>,<hex_d_val>,<a_val>`:
- `b_val` — machine setup PIN (numeric, from initial registration)
- `hex_d_val` — device display name as hex ASCII (e.g. "Pixel 9 Pro" → `506978...`)
- `a_val` — 64-hex auth token issued by the machine during pairing (stored verbatim)

Responses: `@hp4` (no colon) = accepted, stay open · `@hp4:TOKEN` = PIN challenge ·
`@hp5:00` = unknown device, machine closes TCP.

Pairing (subsequent device — confirmed from a JOE pairing packet capture): send
`@HP:<setupPIN>,<nameHex>,` (empty token) → machine returns `@hp4:<TOKEN>` and
shows a "pair with this device?" prompt → user confirms on the machine → reconnect
and send `@HP:<setupPIN>,<nameHex>,<TOKEN>` → `@hp4` (no colon) = paired; store the
token. There is **no** separate "pairing mode" and **no `@HW`/display-PIN** step on
this machine; `@HP:,,` just returns `@hp5:00`. (The `@HP:,,` → `@hp4:TOKEN` →
`@HW:01,PIN` sequence in `JURA_WIFI_PROTOCOL.md` is first-time Wi-Fi init, not
adding a device.) Easiest bootstrap for testing: reuse a known token via the app's
Advanced pairing tab.

### Sessions
Most commands must be wrapped in a **Remote Screen** session:
```
@TS:01   (ack @ts:01)  →  ...commands...  →  @TS:00 (ack @ts:00)
```
Brewing (`@TP:`) and counter reads (`@TR:32`) require this wrapper.

> **Unsolicited frames / desync (important):** the machine spontaneously emits
> `@TS` and `@TF:<status>` frames after auth and on state changes — *not only* in
> response to `@TM:50`. Reading "exactly one frame per command" therefore
> intermittently mis-pairs responses and shifts results (e.g. product counters land
> in the wrong slots). `JuraClient.request(cmd, expectedPrefix)` skips frames until
> the matching echo prefix (`@tr:32`, `@tg:c0`, `@tg:43`, `@ts`), which tolerates the
> pushes and self-heals leftover frames. Always match responses by prefix, never by
> position.

### Key commands
| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `@TP:<32 hex>` | Brew a product (16 fields × 2 hex). Field 0 = product code, 2 = strength (01–0A), 3 = water ml÷5, 5 = milk foam, 6 = temp (00/01/02), 8 = `01`. |
| `@TG:C0` | Maintenance status: 3 bytes (cleaning, filter, descale) as % to service; `FF` = n/a. |
| `@TG:43` | Maintenance counters: 6 × 2-byte big-endian cycle counts. |
| `@TR:32,P` | Product counter page P (4 products × 2 bytes); pages 0–15 cover all. |
| `@TM:50` | **Subscribe** to status. Machine acks (`@tm:D0`) then **pushes** `@TF:<14 hex>` frames periodically until disconnect. Each push is a 7-byte (56-bit) alert word; bit N = `byte[N/8]`, mask `0x80 >> (N%8)` (per-byte, MSB-first). Decode via the model's XML `<ALERTS>` (EF1030 table lives in `MachineStateDecoder`). Verified: tank out → bit 1 "fill water"; ready → bit 13 "coffee ready". |
| `@TG:FF` / `@TG:01` | Cancel / advance current product step. |
| `@TF:02` | Restart machine. |

### Product codes (EF1030 / E6)
`02` Espresso · `03` Coffee · `04` Cappuccino · `06` Espresso Macchiato ·
`08` Milk Foam · `0D` Hot Water · `0F` Powder (inactive) · `28` Caffé Barista ·
`29` Barista Lungo · `31` 2 Espressi · `36` 2 Coffee.
Water amounts must be multiples of 5 ml. **The in-code source of truth is
`:protocol`'s `product/Ef1030Catalog`, derived from protocol reverse engineering** — trust it over `../JURA_WIFI_PROTOCOL.md`
§7, which has errors (it wrongly tags Caffé Barista / Barista Lungo as milk drinks;
they are **coffee + a bypass-water stream `F10`**, no milk). Which parameters each
product even has varies: 2 Espressi / 2 Coffee have **no strength**; Milk Foam has
**only** a milk amount (no water/temp/strength); Caffé Barista / Barista Lungo add
**bypass**. Each adjustable parameter is a nullable `Range` on `Product`.

### Model portability
The cipher, framing, auth, and command set are **identical across all J.O.E.-
supported machines**. What varies per model is data, defined in that model's
XML (`assets/documents/xml/<modelId>/<version>.xml`): product catalogue, the
count/order of maintenance `TEXTITEM`s, and the `@TM:50` alert-bit meanings. To
support a new model, parse its XML rather than hardcoding.

> The Python client (`../jura.py`) is the fastest way to validate any protocol
> assumption against a real machine before porting logic to Kotlin.

## 6. Conventions & guidance for agents

- **Match the surrounding style.** This is a standard Android Studio Compose
  project layout; keep it idiomatic.
- **Versions live in the catalog** (`gradle/libs.versions.toml`). Don't hardcode
  dependency versions in `app/build.gradle.kts`.
- **Don't commit secrets.** `local.properties`, keystores, and `jura_creds.txt`
  are not part of the repo. Credentials/tokens belong in app storage at runtime,
  not in source.
- **Keep transport/protocol code testable and UI-independent** so it can be unit-
  tested on the JVM without an emulator (the cipher in particular has known test
  vectors via the Python client).
- **Verify against reality.** When implementing protocol behavior, cross-check
  with `../jura.py` and, for edge cases, the reference decompiled app sources.
- The reference materials in the parent directory are **outside this git repo** —
  they won't be present after cloning. Treat the condensed spec in §5 as the
  in-repo source of truth and copy anything else you need into the repo (docs or
  tests) rather than relying on `../`.

---

## 7. Roadmap & status

The build proceeds in steps (tracked in the workspace's `andoid_app.md`).

### Guiding strategy

**Thin vertical slices, protocol-first within each slice, ordered by risk and
dependency — not by user-facing flow order.** The protocol layer is a hard
dependency for everything, so it leads; but we never build the whole protocol or
the whole UI in isolation. Each slice goes connect → command → parse → display
and is verified against the real machine (or `../jura.py`) before the next.

Two consequences that are **architectural rules**, not just preferences:

- **Protocol/transport code stays free of Android imports** (pure Kotlin module/
  package) so it is JVM-unit-testable and cross-checkable against `../jura.py`.
- **The connection manager is the single stateful owner** of the one allowed TCP
  session (the machine permits only one connection at a time). Everything else is
  stateless commands/parsers layered over it.

Build-order ≠ user-flow order: credentials are bootstrapped by hand (reuse a
token, as `../jura.py` does) so **pairing UI is deferred**; **safe reads come
before brewing**.

### Steps

- [x] **Step 0** — Project skeleton that compiles in Android Studio and runs an
  empty APK on an emulator.
- [x] **Step 1** — Project docs: this `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`.
- [x] **Step 2** — Protocol core as pure Kotlin (cipher + framing), with JVM unit
  tests against known-good vectors from `../jura.py`. *(Done — `:protocol` module;
  `JuraCipher`, `JuraFrame`, `KeySelector`; `JuraCipherTest` passes including
  byte-for-byte golden frames.)*
- [x] **Step 3** — Transport + connection manager + `@HP:` auth handshake.
  *(Done — `transport/JuraConnection` owns the single TCP socket; `client/JuraClient`
  does `authenticate()` → `AuthResult` and session-wrapped reads.)*
- [x] **Step 4** — First vertical slice: a read flow with minimal UI. *(Done —
  `JuraClient.readReport()` reads product counters `@TR:32`, maintenance `@TG:C0`/
  `@TG:43`, and machine state `@TM:50`; `ui/MainScreen` + `MainViewModel` show it,
  with IP/PIN/device-name/token inputs persisted via `data/JuraSettings`.)*
  **Current state:** verified on real hardware (Jura E6 / EF1030) — auth, product
  counters, maintenance status/counters, and machine state all return correct live
  data. Machine state was corrected: `@TM:50` is a *subscribe* command (the `D0`
  in `@tm:D0` was a mis-parsed echo); real status arrives in streamed `@TF:` push
  frames, decoded by `MachineStateDecoder` (tank-out → "fill water", ready →
  "coffee ready" confirmed, locked in by unit tests).
- [x] **Step 5** — **App scaffolding: navigation + state.** *(Done.)* Single-Activity
  **Navigation Compose** (`ui/JurasApp`, type-safe `ui/Routes`) with a **bottom-nav
  shell** (*Brew* / *Status* / *Settings*); *Preset editor*, *Brewing*, *Pairing* are
  full-screen pushes. Startup gate → Pairing if no device. State persists in
  **DataStore** as JSON via `data/AppStateRepository` over `domain/AppState`
  (`PairedDevice`, `BrewPreset`); `JuraSettings` removed. **OOBE:** default state has
  no presets; on first pairing (clean state) `DefaultPresets.forProducts` seeds one
  preset per catalogue product at factory defaults (via `AppViewModel.pairDevice` →
  `AppStateRepository.pairDevice`, which only seeds when presets are empty).
  `AppViewModel` (shared) owns state + mutations; `StatusViewModel` runs the read
  flow. Read flow moved to `screens/StatusScreen`; `screens/BrewScreen` lists
  presets; `screens/PairingScreen` is manual token entry (real pairing = Step 6).
  Product catalogue + `Temperature` added to `:protocol` (`product/Ef1030Catalog`).
  Brewing/PresetEditor are placeholders. *(Verified in the emulator: navigation +
  migrated read flow work.)*
- [x] **Step 6** — **Pairing** flow + **UDP discovery**. *(Implemented; not yet
  hardware-tested.)* `:protocol`: `discovery/JuraDiscovery` broadcasts the
  `0010A5F3…` scan on UDP/51515 and parses replies into `DiscoveredMachine`
  (derived from protocol analysis; unicast replies, so no extra
  permission); `JuraClient.submitPairingPin()` sends `@HW:01,<pin>`. `:app`:
  `PairingViewModel` runs scan + a held-connection handshake (`@HP:,,` →
  `@hp4:TOKEN`, keep socket open, `@HW:01,<displayPin>` → `@hw:01`) → builds a
  `PairedDevice`. `PairingScreen` is now guided (scan → pick → details → pair) with
  an **Advanced** manual-entry fallback (manual IP + token, as before).
  **Real handshake confirmed from a JOE pairing packet capture and reworked accordingly:**
  1. `@HP:<setupPIN>,<nameHex>,` (empty token) → machine replies `@hp4:<TOKEN>` and
     shows a "pair with this device?" prompt on its display.
  2. Hold the connection while the user confirms on the machine.
  3. Verify: reconnect and send `@HP:<setupPIN>,<nameHex>,<TOKEN>` → `@hp4` (no
     colon) = authenticated/paired; store the token.

  There is **no separate pairing mode and no `@HW`/display-PIN step** — `@HP:,,`
  just returns `@hp5:00` (unknown device). The issued token is effectively
  per-machine/PIN (it matched the existing token even for a new device name).
  `PairingViewModel.startPairing` sends the request and waits (90s read timeout) for
  the machine reply, which only arrives **after** the user confirms on the machine —
  receiving `@hp4:<TOKEN>` is the success signal (no separate Verify step). **Verified
  end-to-end on hardware.** `PairedDevice` distinguishes `label` (this phone's name,
  sent in `@HP` + shown on the machine prompt) from `machineName` (the machine's
  discovered name, for display via `displayName`).
- [x] **Step 7** — **Brew preset editor**. *(Done; builds, not yet hardware-tested —
  it's pure app-side so no machine needed.)* `screens/PresetEditorScreen`: label +
  product dropdown + strength/water/milk sliders (bounded by `Ef1030Catalog`,
  strength/milk shown only when the product supports them) + temperature chips;
  Save/Delete/Cancel via `AppViewModel.upsertPreset`/`deletePreset`. Brew cards now
  separate **edit** (tap or long-press the card) from **brew** (distinct "Brew"
  button) to avoid mis-taps; `+` FAB adds a new preset.
- [x] **Step 8** — **Brewing** (`@TP:`). *(Implemented; builds + payload unit tests
  pass. NOT yet hardware-tested — first real dispense.)* `:protocol`: `TpPayload`
  builds the 32-hex body (strength=F3, water=F4÷5, milk=F6 raw, temp=F7, F9=01,
  bypass=F10÷5; `TpPayloadTest` matches the §6 golden example); `JuraClient.brew`
  wraps `@TS:01`/`@TP`/`@TS:00`, streams `@tb`/`@tv:` via `BrewProgress`, ends on
  `@tf:`/`@tp:00`; stop via `@TG:FF`. `:app`: `BrewViewModel` (connect→auth→brew on
  IO) + `screens/BrewingScreen` (explicit **Start brewing** confirm → progress bar →
  **Stop** → Done). Reached by the card **Brew** button.
  **CAUTION / open question:** the JOE app's decompiled `@TP:` literal is **17
  bytes** (`@TP:0D00002C…`, 34 hex), but `../jura.py` + protocol §6 use **16 bytes**
  (32 hex) and that's what's implemented. If a real brew is rejected or
  mis-doses, capture a JOE brew pcap (like pairing) to confirm the exact field
  layout/length. Bypass placement (F10) and units (÷5) are unverified — test a
  barista product specifically.
  **Brew progress captions:** the `@tv:` state byte (byte 0) maps to names in
  `BrewStateNames`, derived from protocol reverse engineering on EF1030 hardware
  (`0x24` is "Coffee ready", `0x3E` is "Enjoy"; the reference client had these wrong). Active **dispensing**
  is not a caption — it's the product's `ProgressAdjust` value
  (`DISPENSING_STATES = {0x34,0x37,0x3C,0x41}`), which triggers the live ml/percent
  progress (so it now works for hot water/milk too, not just espresso). Confirmed on
  hardware: brewing works; `0x21`→"Heating up", `0x40`→"Fill water tank".

### Architecture decisions (UI + state)

- **One Activity, Navigation Compose.** Screens are composable destinations, not
  separate Activities (shared ViewModels, back stack, transitions).
- **Persistence: DataStore + kotlinx.serialization JSON** holding one `AppState`
  (`pairedDevice: PairedDevice?`, `presets: List<BrewPreset>`), exposed as a
  reactive `Flow` by `AppStateRepository`. One paired machine for now.
- **Preset = a configured product.** `BrewPreset` (app domain) stores chosen
  values and references a product by code. The product **catalogue** (codes,
  ranges, which fields apply, defaults) is **per-model reference data in
  `:protocol`** — hardcode `Ef1030Catalog` now (from `../jura.py` PRODUCTS / the
  EF1030 XML), parse from machine XML later. `Temperature` (LOW/NORMAL/HIGH →
  wire 0/1/2) lives in `:protocol`; presets/state live in `:app`.
- Deps added along the way: `navigation-compose`, `kotlinx-serialization`
  (plugin + json), `datastore`, `sh.calvin.reorderable` (drag-to-reorder presets).
- Brew list (`screens/BrewScreen`) is a reorderable `LazyColumn`: each card has a
  **drag handle** (`longPressDraggableHandle` — hold to reorder so scrolling past it
  doesn't accidentally trigger it; persisted via `AppViewModel.reorderPresets`),
  **body tap/long-press** (edit), and a **Brew** button — three distinct actions.
  Local order state is synced from the persisted flow via `LaunchedEffect` and
  committed on drag stop.
- **Quick brew (one-time, not saved):** a "Quick brew" header button on the Brew
  screen opens `screens/PresetEditorScreen` in quick-brew mode (it takes `onBrewNow`
  instead of `onSave`/`onDelete`; same screen, two modes). "Brew" stashes the
  ephemeral `BrewPreset` in `AppViewModel.pendingBrew` and navigates to
  `Route.Brewing(presetId = null)`, which resolves the preset from `pendingBrew`
  rather than the saved list. Saved-preset brews pass a non-null `presetId`.

When you complete a step, update this checklist and the "current state" note so
the next session knows where things stand.
